# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
This project allowed me to build a Node.js command line application that takes in user input about employees on a software engineering team. Using the information inputed by the user an HTML webpage gets generated to display the user input data. During this project I learned about using constructors and classes to create employee objects. In addition I also learned how to be able to test my code using Jest.
